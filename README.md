# **Principal Component Analysis**

This is an open source project that enables you to understand with mathematical details 
the technique of **dimensionality reduction** called **Principal Component Analysis**.

This work was conceived by the person who wrotes this description and the same who did the full work,
who was an ex-student of Applied Mathematics departement of Cadi Ayyad University.

The goal of this work is to help anyone to understand the beauty of combining 
mathematics and computer science and to come up with great conclusions from raw data.


## **What are the files in this repository ?**

In this repository, you will find the following:

- A detailed report of the Principal Component Analysis method as a pdf file.

- A dataset in csv format.

- Code in R language attached to the numerical application of the method.


## **What does the files contain ?**

First, the pdf file is a report of the Principal Component Analysis method. It contain the full mathematical details about the method with an example of students grades discussed while explaining.
On the last chapter of the work, you will be facing a numerical application with R software about:
        
        Death Causes in Morocco between 1990 and 2017.


## **Last words..**

I hope you will enjoy this work and I definetly hope I've achieved the goal of giving the necessary details
about a fundamental and an important dimensionality reduction such as the Principal Component Analysis technique.
